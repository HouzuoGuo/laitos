**laitos** software suite offers all you need for hosting a personal website,
receiving Emails, blocking ads with a DNS server.

whenever and wherever! laitos inter-operates with
[telephone, SMS](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/laitos/wiki/%5BWeb-service%5D-Twilio-telephone-SMS-hook),

## Project name and origin

In late 2015/early 2016, a much smaller program called
["websh"](http://github.com/HouzuoGuo/websh) was created to offer basic shell
access via SMS and telephone. The laitos project evolved from the smaller
program, restarted from scratch in late 2016, and throughout 2017 the project
gained a full suite of web servers along with integration to social networks and
utility apps.

Finland is my favourite country and a good Finnish friend on IRC by the name of
"zutt" recommended Finnish word "laitos" (meaning institute, apparently) to
replace the old name "websh". I do not understand the rationale, but it sounds
cute enough to name a project.
